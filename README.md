# Computer-Science-Skills
Faculty subject Computer Science Skills.
## Content (Syllabus outline)
The course is practically oriented and intended for
introducing the students to practical work on specific
platforms and in specific languages that are not
included in other courses or have appeared only
recently and are important for practical work and for
completing specific tasks, and projects. Examples of
such topics are specific programming languages (Coq,
Scheme, Dart, Ceylon, Go, F#, Opa,...) and platforms
(Mathematica,Django, Android, iOS), new and emerging
technologies (quantum computers, DNA computers,...)
and new approaches to computing (quantum
computing, Blue Brain project,...) . Such new topics and
concepts regularly appear in computer and information
science and it is reasonable to give the students an
opportunity to learn about them.
## Objectives and competences
The object of this course is mastering and
understanding efficient practical solutions and gaining a
thorough understanding of specific tools, programming
languages, or platforms.
## Intended learning outcomes
### Lerning and understanding
The students are acquainted with practical work
using specific tools and specific platforms.
### Application
Applying state-of-the-art techniques and approaches
on a chosen plafrorm, language, or tool.
### Reflection
A thorough knowledge of a specific state-of-the-art
tool or platform, a close encounter with practical
problems and solutions in specific programming and
engineering work in computer and information
science.
### Transferable skills
Understanding »tricks of the trade«, developing a
flexibility and ability to adapt to work in different
contexts.
